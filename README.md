# DeveloperProfileGenerator

This application is designed to prompt a user to input their Github user name and to choose a color. Once this is done, the application dynamically creates a color-themed pdf containing information from their Github profile.

## Interface
The user simply needs to answer the questions when prompted, and the application will then take over, dynamically creating both an html and pdf file.
